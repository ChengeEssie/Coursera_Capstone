Foursquare, which is a massive database on location data, will be used in this project to access data on boroughs and neighbourhoods in Stockton. From the database, neighbourhoods in Stockton will be retrieved, segmented, and explored based on their respective venues. They will then be compared and the neighbourhood that best suits John\u2019s profile will be determined. "
